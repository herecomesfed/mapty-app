## Overview

### The Project

This project was created by Jonas Schmedtmann to aid his students in mastering OOP in JavaScript.

The purpose of this app is to enable users to track their workout progress on a map, choosing between running and cycling. To use the app, simply click on the map to record the completed workout; this information is then saved in local storage, allowing users to track their progress even after closing the app.
